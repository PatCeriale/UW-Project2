## Description

Whale Hunter is a beer tracking, search engine and social media app that is built to be your go to for beer discovery. Browse our app and explore new beers to taste while learning more about new beers and the breweries that made them. Save those beers to a "six pack" for referencing later. Share your experiences with your friends and strangers by posting about your experience, sharing your created six packs, and by rating beer by using our innovative Ahab scale.

## **Usage**

Open the url (https://whalehunterbeer.herokuapp.com/) in your favorite browser and sign up using the "sign up" tab in the navbar. Once signed in, feel free to browse our database of beers either in full, by brewery or by style. If you need a little guidance, we have supplied a list of some of the popular breweries on the home page. Create a current six pack to add beers to by clicking the "Current Six Pack" tab in the navbar, name the six pack appropriately with the beers you want to add and click "Create Six Pack". When you find a beer you are interested in while browsing, click the "add to my current six pack" button and that beer will be loaded to your six packs.

Also available to the signed in user, is the ability to post to the main page! Click the "Create Post" button and fill out the form to let the world know about your experience with that beer.
