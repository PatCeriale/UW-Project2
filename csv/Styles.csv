1,IPA,"Steeped in lore (and extra hops), the English-style IPA is a stronger version of a pale ale. The English-style pale ale is characterized by a hearty helping of English hop character (earthy, floral) and increased alcohol content. English yeast lend a fruity character to the flavor and aroma, offering a contrast to the earthy English hop additions. Different from its American counterpart, this style strikes a balance between malt and hops for a more rounded flavor.There is also a lot of mythology surrounding the creation of this style, which is still debated today. It is most commonly believed that English style pale ale was birthed from the need for a beer that could survive the journey to and from India, a land too warm for beer brewing without the aid of modern technology. The increased alcohol and hop contents would act as preservatives, giving IPAs the qualities that they are known for to this day. In actuality, the beer style that would become popularly known as an India pale ale bears little in common with the contemporary iteration you enjoy today. Additionally, beers similar to what made the trip to India had been in production for domestic consumption prior to any reports of it being exported and records show that other beer styles, including porter, made their way to the English colony of India and were enjoyed by parched soldiers and colonists.",,,http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603493489/TestProject/jt0qkkfagqplytjdkt4o.png
2,Porter,"Definitively American, the imperial porter should have no roasted barley flavors or strong burnt/black malt character. Medium caramel and cocoa-like sweetness is present, with complementing hop character and malt-derived sweetness.",,,http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603570881/TestProject/caxrbrxq5ksgdwxly1rf.jpg
3,Red Ale,"The use of American hops in the American imperial red ale lends to the perception of medium hop bitterness, flavor and aroma. Coupled with a solid malt profile, this should be a beer with balance between hop bitterness and malt sweetness. This is another example of modern American brewers taking an established style and boosting the flavor. California brewers are credited with creating this innovative style.",,,http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603570941/TestProject/ghje5t0dzdut3aq1fueh.jpg
4,Brown Ale,"Roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be of medium intensity in both flavor and aroma for the American brown ale. American-style brown ales have evident low to medium hop flavor and aroma and medium to high hop bitterness. The history of this style dates back to U.S. homebrewers who were inspired by English-style brown ales and porters. It sits in flavor between those British styles and is more bitter than both.",,,http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603571140/TestProject/sn17wcuavqrkrz8inurw.jpg
5,Cream Ale,"The American cream ale is a mild, pale, light-bodied ale, made using a warm fermentation (top or bottom fermenting yeast) and cold lagering. Despite being called an ale, when being judged in competitions it is acceptable for brewers to use lager yeast.",,,http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603571328/TestProject/jwcz6arjqif5wytjpajr.jpg
6,Pale Ale,"Characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous American hops, the American pale ale is a medium-bodied beer with low to medium caramel, and carries with it a toasted maltiness. American pale ale is one of the most food-friendly styles to enjoy, since the pale ale works wonderfully with lighter fare such as salads and chicken, but can still stand up to a hearty bowl of chili; a variety of different cheeses, including cheddar; seafood, like steamed clams or fish, and even desserts. The American pale ale’s affinity to food can be attributed to the simplicity of its ingredients, which include toasty pale malt, a clean fermenting ale beer yeast, and the counterbalance of American hops to help tease out the flavor or cleanse the palate, preparing you for another bite.",,,http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603571485/TestProject/q6qtv9k44jehopb8enpy.jpg
7,Stout,"Strikingly bold and undeniably beautiful, the American stout beer style blends generous amounts of dark malts with American hops to offer an adventurous experience that is unmatched by other styles of beer. Are you afraid of the dark? When it comes to American stout, don’t be. Allow your senses to run wild with this deceivingly sophisticated take on a European staple.",,,http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603572236/TestProject/qe6q7mwdngq6wamkgq4i.jpg
8,Pilsner,"A classic German-style pilsner is straw to pale in color with a malty sweetness that can be perceived in aroma and flavor. Perception of hop bitterness is medium to high. Noble-type hop aroma and flavor are moderate and quite obvious. Distinctly different from the Bohemian-style pilsner , this style is lighter in color and body and has a lower perceived hop bitterness.",,,http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603572204/TestProject/t2erkoqiziktvo6jhxnh.jpg
9,Marzen,"A beer rich in malt with a balance of clean, hop bitterness, similar to the Vienna lager. Toasted bread or biscuit-like malt aroma and flavor is to be expected. Originating in Germany, this style was traditionally brewed in the spring (“Marzen” meaning “March”) and aged, or lagered, throughout the summer. A stronger version was served at early Oktoberfest celebrations and became known as Oktoberfest. Today, the festival’s version of an Oktoberfest is quite a bit lighter than what American craft brewers consider an Oktoberfest.",,,http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603572142/TestProject/l3bdddtyb4kiyadssisl.jpg
10,Amber,"A widely available, sessionable craft beer style that showcases both malt and hops. Amber lagers are a medium-bodied lager with a toasty or caramel-like malt character. Hop bitterness can range from very low to medium-high. Brewers may use decoction mash and dry-hopping to achieve advanced flavors.",,,http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603572096/TestProject/hjtuclkcv607qpxrkb8j.jpg
11,Blond,"One of the most approachable styles, a golden or blonde ale is an easy-drinking beer that is visually appealing and has no particularly dominating malt or hop characteristics. Rounded and smooth, it is an American classic known for its simplicity. Sometimes referred to as “golden ale.” These beers can have honey, spices and fruit added, and may be fermented with lager or ale yeast.",,,http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603572059/TestProject/se5kmgu9ozvbhxtbsrj4.jpg
12,Sour,"The acidity present in sour beer is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash, or produced during fermentation by the use of various microorganisms. These beers may derive their sour flavor from pure cultured forms of souring agents or from the influence of barrel aging.",,,http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603572021/TestProject/cgqbgrjiwk0mfwssdxid.jpg
13,Barleywine,"Despite its name, a Barleywine (or Barley Wine) is very much a beer, albeit a strong and often intense beer. In fact, it's one of the strongest styles. Lively and fruity, sometimes sweet, sometimes bittersweet, but always alcoholic. A brew of this strength and complexity can be a challenge to the palate.",,,http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603571972/TestProject/mlqry1mrucwcswbuvmdl.jpg
14,Double IPA,"Double (or Imperial) India Pale Ales (IPAs) can resemble everything from a Pale Ale to a Barleywine, reserved International Bitterness Units (IBU) to hundreds, from pale to black in color. On top of that, this truly unique American style has also been interpreted by brewers around the world who also put their signature twists on the style; for instance, Belgian IPAs, many of which resemble hoppy, unfiltered Tripels.",,,http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603571938/TestProject/nnpi0a67r6jb6zmdg9p0.jpg
15,Lager,"American lager has little in the way of hop and malt character. A straw to gold, very clean and crisp, highly carbonated lager.",,,http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603571909/TestProject/vdlvncd5qdpbpeppzesv.jpg
16,Rauchbier,"When malt is kilned over an open flame, the smoke flavor becomes infused into the beer, leaving a taste that can vary from dense campfire, to slight wisps of smoke. Any style of beer can be smoked; the goal is to reach a balance between the style’s character and the smoky properties. Originating in Germany as rauchbier, this style is open to interpretation by U.S. craft brewers. Classic base styles include German-style Marzen/Oktoberfest, German-style bock, German-style dunkel, Vienna-style lager and more. Smoke flavors dissipate over time.",,,http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603571849/TestProject/uj1i4hh0hf4njl922q6y.jpg
17,Wheatwine,"Part of the “strong ale” category, the American-Style Wheat Wine Ale is not derived from grapes as its name might suggest. Made with at least 50 percent wheat malt, this full-bodied beer features bready and candy flavors, and finishes with a great deal of malty sweetness.",,,http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603571812/TestProject/kue5m8xmex7mxiv49im5.jpg
18,Oatmeal Stout,"The addition of oatmeal adds a smooth, rich body to the oatmeal stout. This beer style is dark brown to black in color. Roasted malt character is caramel-like and chocolate-like, and should be smooth and not bitter. Coffee-like roasted barley and malt aromas are prominent. This low- to medium-alcohol style is packed with darker malt flavors and a rich and oily body from oatmeal.",,,http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603571775/TestProject/pe6qodxfx6wjepmdoozn.jpg
19,Belgian Dark Strong,"The Belgian-style dubbel ranges from brown to very dark in color. They have a malty sweetness and can have cocoa and caramel aromas and flavors. Hop bitterness is medium-low to medium. Yeast-generated fruity esters (especially banana) can be apparent. Often bottle-conditioned, a slight yeast haze and flavor may be evident. “Dubbel” meaning “double,” this beer is still not so big in intensity as to surpass the Belgian-style quadrupel that is often considered its sibling.",,,http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603571741/TestProject/yyizoi8y7f1q6o6mxysa.jpg
20,Scotch Ale,"The Scotch ale is overwhelmingly malty, with a rich and dominant sweet malt flavor and aroma. A caramel character is often part of the profile. Some examples feature a light smoked peat flavor. This style could be considered the Scottish version of an English-style barley wine. Overly smoked versions would be considered specialty examples.",,,http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603571702/TestProject/foqfadzsoidhsofsk0yx.jpg
21,Spice Beer,"An herb and spice beer is a lager or ale that contains flavors derived from flowers, roots, seeds or certain fruits or vegetables. Typically the hop character is low, allowing the added ingredient to shine through. The appearance, mouthfeel and aromas vary depending on the herb or spice used. This beer style encompasses innovative examples as well as traditional holiday and winter ales.",,,http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603571674/TestProject/tkqgu5faroxps4riozqv.jpg
22,Dark Lager,"This beer's malt aroma and flavor are low but notable. Its color ranges from a very deep copper to a deep, dark brown. It has a clean, light body with discreet contributions from caramel and roasted malts. Non-malt adjuncts are often used, and hop rates are low. Hop bitterness is clean and has a short duration of impact. Hop flavor, and aroma are low. Carbonation is high. Fruity esters, diacetyl, and chill haze should not be perceived.",,,http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603571626/TestProject/bq38ot2wvmq9nufsdihq.jpg
23,Bitter,"The English-style bitter is a very sessionable, lower-alcohol, malt-driven style. Broad style description commonly associated with cask-conditioned beers. The light- to medium-bodied ordinary bitter is gold to copper in color, with a low residual malt sweetness. Hop bitterness is medium.",,,http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603571590/TestProject/mjg230oaudymalnhoaul.jpg
24,hefeweizen,"The German-style hefeweizen is straw to amber in color and brewed with at least 50 percent malted wheat. The aroma and flavor of a weissbier comes largely from the yeast and is decidedly fruity (banana) and phenolic (clove). The intensity of these wildly differing flavor qualities varies depending on the brewer, but the two are most commonly balanced. Hefeweizen typically contains a low to moderate alcohol content and is considered to be the most popular amongst the German weissbier variety.",,,http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603571552/TestProject/u1ttckhjmtjxprhzw0jr.jpg
25,Dark Ale,"The American black ale is characterized by the perception of caramel malt and dark roasted malt flavor and aroma. Hop bitterness is perceived to be medium-high to high. Hop flavor and aroma are medium-high. Fruity, citrus, piney, floral and herbal character from hops of all origins may contribute to the overall experience. This beer is often called a black IPA or Cascadian dark ale.",,,http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603571509/TestProject/za5xngharzsmqbuk1mzx.jpg
26,Kristallweizen,"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier without yeast is very similar to Weissbier with yeast (Hefeweizen/Hefeweissbier) with the caveat that fruity and phenolic characters are not combined with the yeasty flavor and fuller-bodied mouthfeel of yeast. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated, yet its relatively high starting gravity and alcohol content make it a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to deep golden. Because the beer has been filtered, yeast is not present. The beer will have no flavor of yeast and a cleaner, drier mouthfeel. The beer should be clear with no chill haze present. No diacetyl should be perceived.",,,http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603571467/TestProject/fgdboxusm9gdkoymgquw.jpg
27,English pale ale beers,"Like the IPA, always offer great beer pairing opportunities. Strong English cheeses as well as grilled or braised meats, like pork, can make very tasty flavor experiences when paired with an English IPA. The higher alcohol, hops and carbonation all work to cut through fat and cleanse the palate, helping every bite be as tasty as the first.",,,http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603570718/TestProject/vc9dqowhhdo9rvoxjsyz.jpg
