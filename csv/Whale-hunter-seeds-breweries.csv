In May of 2017, after 14 years selling beer, we went from a draft-only production facility to canning select full-time beers (hey, we always said “never say never”). Sorry, still no brewpub, but we do have a retail shop where you can pick up kegs to go, growlers, cans and perhaps get a taste of our newest beer. Or you could be social and get out to your favorite local watering hole. The only thing that hasn’t changed, we’re still focused on one thing…brewing darn tasty beer.",http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603490092/TestProject/svf9bj3xfrqw7iovurb3.png

3,Elysian Brewing Company,1221 East Pike Street,,Seattle,Washington,98122,2068603977,null,http://www.elysianbrewing.com/,"The Elysian was founded in 1995 by principals Dick Cantwell (President/Head Brewer), Joe Bisacca (CFO/Head of Operations) and David Buhler (Sales & Marketing Director). Our first Seattle location, a 220-seat beer hall and our main brewery, opened in 1996 on Capitol Hill, Seattle’s most populous neighborhood. In 1997 Elysian was chosen to operate a pub and small brewery at Gameworks—a large entertainment complex owned by Universal Studios, Dreamworks & Sega. Elysian left this partnership in 2002 upon expiration of the five-year contract. A short year later Elysian opened TangleTown, an 80-seat neighborhood brewery/bistro. With a 3-bbl pilot brewery, Elysian-TangleTown acted as the brewers' test kitchen, fueling the creative fires and helping cement Elysian's reputation as Seattle’s top brewpub. The most recent addition to the Elysian empire, Elysian Fields, opened in August 2006. Perched next to Seattle’s two sports arenas, Fields seats 400 and packs the house at lunch and on gamedays. It is typical for us to offer over twenty different Elysian beers between the three locations.",http://res.cloudinary.com/crowandrew/image/upload/v1603492697/TestProject/zpggwyn7aldpldltzcy8.png
